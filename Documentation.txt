Entry Point Architecture (The Routing)
Root index.html (The Redirector)

Location: /index.html (Project Root)

Technical Role: This is a "dummy" file specifically for GitHub Pages compatibility.

Function: Its only job is to immediately redirect the browser to the real homepage located at public/index.html.

Interaction: It does not load any CSS or JS; it simply handles the initial URL hit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

public/index.html (The Main Landing Page)

Location: /public/index.html

Technical Role: The true "Front Desk" of your application.

Role: Designed to be fast, SEO-friendly, and informative for potential members.

Key Components:

Hero Section: Features a dynamic display powered by slideshow.js.

Public Navigation: A standard header and mobile drawer managed by menu.js.

Information Hub: Sections for Membership plans, Timetables, FAQ, and Contacts.

Authentication Forms: Hidden structures for Login and Registration that are activated by modals.js.

JavaScript Interaction: Loads the full UI suite (faq.js, smooth-scroll.js, slideshow.js, menu.js, and modals.js).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

dashboard.html (The Member Portal)

Location: /public/dashboard.html

Technical Role: A "Protected Area" for authenticated users.

Key UI Components:

Desktop Sidebar: A persistent aside element for navigation and logout.

Mobile Header: A sticky top bar with a "Welcome" message and a burger menu trigger.

Mobile Drawer (#mobile-menu): A slide-out navigation menu for small screens.

Activity Stats: Grid cards showing Workouts, Streaks, and Ranks.

JavaScript Interaction: * Loads dashboard-menu.js as a type="module".

Interacts with auth-handler.js for secure logout functionality.

Relies on auth-session.js to ensure the user is logged in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

timetable.html (The Schedule)

Location: /public/timetable.html

Role: A focused utility page showing the gym's weekly training schedule.

Interaction: Linked from both the public index.html and the private dashboard.html.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

auth-handler.js (The Service Layer)

Role: This is the central hub for communicating with your backend server.

Key Functions:

handleLogout(): Sends a request to the server to end the session and then redirects the user back to the landing page.

setupForms(): Attaches listeners to Login and Registration forms to validate data before sending it to the API.

Interactions: It is imported by dashboard-menu.js to enable logout functionality from both the desktop sidebar and the mobile drawer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

auth-session.js (The Gatekeeper)

Role: Manages the user's active session.

Technical Logic: It checks for a valid token (usually in localStorage or cookies). If a user tries to access dashboard.html without being logged in, this script triggers a redirect back to index.html.

Interactions: Runs immediately when a protected page loads to ensure security.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Utility & Helper Files
These files provide "shortcuts" and common tools used by the other scripts.

helpers.js (The Toolbelt)

Role: Contains small, reusable functions that aren't tied to one specific feature.

Functions: Might include closeMenu() logic, date formatters, or DOM selectors used to keep other files like dashboard-menu.js or menu.js clean.

Benefit: If you need to change how a menu closes, you change it here once, and it updates everywhere.

main.js (The Orchestrator)

Role: Often acts as the "Entry Point" for JavaScript. It determines which page the user is on and initializes the correct scripts (like starting the slideshow only on the homepage).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Special Feature Scripts (UI Logic)
These control specific interactive elements on the pages.

slideshow.js: Handles the timing and transition effects for the hero images on index.html.

faq.js: Manages the "Accordion" behavior—opening and closing answers when a user clicks a question.

modals.js: Listens for clicks on "Login" or "Join Now" buttons to show/hide the pop-up forms.

smooth-scroll.js: Overrides the default browser "jump" behavior so that clicking navigation links slides the page smoothly to the target section.
